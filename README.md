# 📊 Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in social media comments and categorizing them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. The analysis is performed using deep learning models like MLP and LSTM, and the project also includes an API that allows users to input a comment and receive a sentiment classification in real-time.
(Using Indonesian language).

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Project Goals
- Build a robust model to classify social media comments based on sentiment.
- Develop an API that can take a comment as input and return its sentiment classification.
- Implement effective preprocessing steps to handle noisy and informal text.

### Features
- **Sentiment Analysis Models**: Trained using MLP and LSTM for accurate classification.
- **Real-time Sentiment Prediction**: API that returns sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) when given a comment.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Handles slang, emojis, and other social media-specific language nuances.

### 🗂️ Repository Explanation
- **train_preprocess.tsv**: Original dataset containing social media comments
- **new_kamusalay.csv**: For data cleansing needs.
- **NN_MLP.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for training MLP model.
- **LSTM.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for training LSTM model.
- **app.py**: Flask API for predicting sentiment based on input comment.
- **model_mlp.p**: Saved MLP model.
- **model_lstm.h5**: Saved LSTM model.
- **Others**: Required libraries and dependencies.
